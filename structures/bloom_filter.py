class BloomFilter:
    """
    A BloomFilter uses a BitVector as a container. To insert a given key, we
    hash the key using a series of h unique hash functions to set h bits.
    Looking up a given key follows the same logic, but only checks if all
    bits are set or not.

    Note that a BloomFilter is considered static. It is initialized with the
    number of total keys desired (as a parameter) and will not grow. You
    must decide what this means in terms of allocating your bitvector space
    accordingly.

    You can add functions if you need to.

    *** A NOTE ON KEYS ***
    We will only ever use int or str keys.
    We will not use `None` as a key.
    You might like to look at the `object_to_byte_array` function
    stored in util.py -- This function can be used to convert a string
    or integer key into a byte array, and then you can use the byte array
    to make your own hash function (bytes are just integers in the range
    [0-255] of course).
