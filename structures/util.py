    This converts any object into a byte array. The byte array can then
    be iterated across to yield integers. This may be useful for hashing
    arbitrary objects.
    
    Example:
    x = 1234

    for byte_int in x_bytes:
        print(byte_int, type(byte_int))


    WARNING: If you are interpreting objects as byte arrays for hashing,
    you had better not let the object be mutated, or the hash will be
    different (screaming.mp4) and this will make things break. Our
    recommendation is to only use this on simple types like str or int
