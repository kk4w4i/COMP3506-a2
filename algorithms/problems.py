 Each problem will be assessed on three sets of tests:

1. "It works":
       Basic inputs and outputs, including the ones peovided as examples, with generous time and memory restrictions.
       Large inputs will not be tested here.
       The most straightforward approach will likely fit into these restrictions.

2. "Exhaustive":
       Extensive testing on a wide range of inputs and outputs with tight time and memory restrictions.
       These tests won't accept brute force solutions, you'll have to apply some algorithms and optimisations.

 3. "Welcome to COMP3506":
       Extensive testing with the tightest possible time and memory restrictions
       leaving no room for redundant operations.
       Every possible corner case will be assessed here as well.

There will be hidden tests in each category that will be published only after the assignment deadline.

You may wish to import your data structures to help you with some of the
problems. Or maybe not. We did it for you just in case.

    The BitVector should be read from index 0 upwards (so, the first symbol is
    encoded from index 0). You also need to return your codebook as a
    Python list of unique Entries. The Entry key should correspond to the
    symbol, and the value should be a string. More information below.
